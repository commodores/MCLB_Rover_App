# 🤖 pymavlink_app
*The rover control web application for the MCLB Rover (HAZ Bot Project)*  
*Built using Flask and Socket.IO*

This application allows remote monitoring and control of the rover in real time, including mission uploading, telemetry display, and manual overrides via a clean web interface.

## 🧠 General Info

The 'pymavlink_app' serves as a mission control web server for a MAVLink-compatible ground rover (e.g., running ArduPilot). The CubePilot Pixhawk connects to a Raspberry Pi via USB, establishing a MAVLink communication link. A touchscreen monitor is connected to the Raspberry Pi and embedded into the rover’s frame to enable onboard interaction.

- Arm and disarm the rover
- Upload and manage autonomous missions
- Monitor real-time telemetry
- Control the rover through a touchscreen interface

## ⚙️ Technologies

### Core Stack
- **OS:** Ubuntu Linux Desktop (running on Raspberry Pi 4)
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Web Framewrok:** Flask  
- **Real-Time Communication:** Flask-SocketIO (WebSockets)

### 🌐 Frontend

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – UI styling and interactivity  
- **Jinja2** – Template rendering for Flask  
- **Socket.IO** – Used for live updates and telemetry push/pull

### 📡Mavlink Integration
- **Library** - pymavlink (Python implementation of MAVLink protocol)

**Sends commands such as**:
- Arming/disarming the rover
- Switching modes (AUTO, MANUAL, HOLD)
- Uploading and starting waypoint missions
- Receiving telemetry (GPS, battery, system status)
  
Managed in real time via a Python MAVLink connection (`mavutil`)
